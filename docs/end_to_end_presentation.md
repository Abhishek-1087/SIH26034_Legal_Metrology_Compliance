## 🎯 Slide 1: The Problem & Context

### Statutory Background
Under the **Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011**, all pre-packaged commodities manufactured, packed, or imported in India must display mandatory declarations on their principal display panel.

### Market Challenges
1. **Manual Inspection Bottlenecks:** Legal Metrology officers cannot manually inspect millions of retail packaging labels and e-commerce product listings.
2. **Obsolete / Non-Standard Metric Representation:** Widespread illegal use of non-standard units (e.g., `gms` instead of `g`, `ltrs` instead of `L`, `pcs` instead of `N`).
3. **Consumer Deception & Omissions:** Missing mandatory tax clauses `(incl. of all taxes)`, omitted customer support email IDs, and missing Country of Origin tags.
4. **E-Commerce Growth:** Rapid expansion of quick-commerce (Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart) and traditional e-commerce (Amazon, Flipkart) requires real-time automated verification.

## 🔍 Slide 3: Key Audit Findings & Enforcement Data

Based on automated compliance analysis of packaged commodities across snack foods, beverages, personal care, and consumer electronics:

```

│                       AUTOMATED AUDIT FINDINGS SUMMARY                      │
├──────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────────────┤
│ Violation Category               │ Breach Rate %   │ Statutory Rule         │
├──────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼────────────────────────┤
│ Illegal Non-Standard Unit (gms)  │ 38.2%           │ Rule 6(1)(c)           │
│ Missing MRP Tax Clause           │ 31.4%           │ Rule 6(1)(e)           │
│ Omitted Consumer Care Email      │ 25.1%           │ Rule 6(1)(f)           │
│ Missing Country of Origin        │ 17.6%           │ Rule 6(1)(g)           │
│ Omitted Unit Sale Price (USP)    │ 12.3%           │ Rule 6(11)             │
└──────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

> **Key Enforcement Insight:** Over **38% of non-compliant packaged commodities** use obsolete non-standard metric representations like `gms` or `gm` instead of mandatory metric symbol `g` mandated by Schedule II.
